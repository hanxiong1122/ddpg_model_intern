# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Management
* This is done as CSCI 599 deep learning and its applications final project at USC Fall 2017
* For more information, you can read our [report](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~zhan527/post/cs599/)

## Algorithms used in this work
* Imitation Learning
* Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient

## Dataset
* We use dataset from kaggle. It can be found [here](https://github.com/CNuge/kaggle_code/blob/master/stock_data/all_stocks_5yr.csv)
